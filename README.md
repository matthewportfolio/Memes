This project is my attempt at recreating a traditional Social Media infinite scrolling "Feed". It's my first proper time using React, and I really enjoyed it. A fluid, compact and attractive experience is what I was going for here. Everything is fully animated also, using the animation library Pose. I'm definitely going to explore more front-end development in the future.
